## Description 
This is a Portfolio page created to show my work and present myself as a competitive hire. 

This was made using HTML and CSS. The main tools used were flex-box, css classes, ids, pseudo-classes and variables.

This project has taught me about using flex-box for aligning items, making hover effects for images and links, and methods of responsive design.
